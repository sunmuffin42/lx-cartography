Mapping Linguistic Theory

  Stuff written for <a href = "http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html">WebVOWL</a> 1.1.2, which takes a JSON and compiles it to the graph. If you want to try using an RDF to JSON converter, OWL2VOWL exists (on the same webpage), but it's buggy and doesn't have detailed documentation. My recommendation is to just use the Python script to add to the existing JSON
