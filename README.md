Mapping Linguistic Theory

  Stuff written for <a href = "http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html">WebVOWL</a> 1.1.2, which takes a JSON and compiles it to the graph. If you want to try using an RDF to JSON converter, OWL2VOWL exists (on the same webpage), but it's buggy and doesn't have detailed documentation. My recommendation is to just use the Python script to add to the existing JSON. 
  To use WebVOWL, download the software, which is just a website, and hover over Ontology at the bottom. Click on the bottom bar to upload the JSON you want to view. Use lx_cartography_ontology.json to see the basic ontology proposed. Use lx_cartography_sample.json to view the current sample of the ontology in use. If you choose to run the python script to add things into the sample, use the new file created, lx_cartography_sample2.json
